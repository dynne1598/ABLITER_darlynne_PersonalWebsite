					<i><b><p>"SUNFLOWERS ARE HUGE,AND SO AS MY FOREHEAD, HUGE AND WIDE AS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORTS SINCE 1998"</p></b></i>

					<p>"At age 12, I worked as a cashier in a known market in our barangay, Some would have called it Child Labour, but I called it as the best experience of my life. Meeting with the different kind of people with a taste of different variety of attitude and personalities"</p>

					<p>And since my Dad is a member of the Philippine Navy, doesn't mean I have anything I want. I was taught by my parents to  stand on my own and work my ass as possible and be flexible in any change. But I think everyone does.</p>

				<div class="col2">
					<p>I love to composed my own songs and write poems, becuase I do believe that writing speaks our thoughts that our mouth can't. and to add things for what I like, I like singing and make funny faces which is really my huge talent (I guess)</p>

					<p>I asked too many questions, because I am curious of everything, like literally every thing. I wonder a lot, too many "what if's", "Hows?" and Little wars in my mind.</p>

					<p>Sometimes I was thinking that my mind is like a ball of wires, each things are connected that causes me to overthink a lot.</p>
				</div>

				<!-- end of col2 -->

				<div class="col3">
					<p>I used to work online,making blogs and editing a not so difficult images and I personally loved it ! but dealing with lack of sleep was too hard.</p>

					<p>I love photography, editing videos, making vlogs about fashion literacy and trends. Giving some tips for girls on how to rock their fashions without a need of big amount of money.</p>

					<p>I was thinking that maybe on that way I would have be able to help them look more vibrant and plus in that way I would also be able to enhance my skills and talent for doing that stuff.</p>
